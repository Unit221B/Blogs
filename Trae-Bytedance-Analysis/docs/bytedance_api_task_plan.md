# Task Plan: ByteDance API Computer Use CLI Implementation

## Important Clarification
**IMPORTANT**: Trae is the actual API/service being reverse engineered here. Cursor is simply one client application that uses the Trae API. These are separate entities - our focus is understanding and implementing the Trae API.

## 1. Authentication Flow
- [x] Implement JWT token parsing and validation
- [x] Create token refresh mechanism
- [x] Add simulation for extending token expiration
- [x] Implement authentication headers (Cloud-IDE-JWT format)
- [x] Test authentication with production endpoints (verified /api/ide/v1/ping works but full authentication requires actual credentials)

## 2. API Endpoint Integration
- [x] Implement base URL configuration (US/SG regions)
- [x] Connect to ByteDance LLM endpoints
- [x] Map ByteDance API parameters correctly
- [x] Handle streaming response format

## 3. Computer Use Implementation
- [x] Capture and parse computer use events
- [x] Implement terminal command execution (simulation)
- [x] Add file system interaction capabilities (simulation)
- [ ] Create sandboxed execution environment
- [x] Implement result feedback to API

## 4. CLI Interface
- [x] Create command structure (chat, session, refresh)
- [x] Add interactive conversation mode
- [x] Implement token management commands
- [x] Add computer use toggle flag
- [x] Create verbose debug logging for API calls

## 5. Session Management
- [x] Implement conversation storage
- [x] Create history browsing capabilities
- [x] Add session persistence across restarts
- [x] Implement selective conversation export

## 6. Testing Framework
- [x] Add non-interactive test mode
- [x] Implement direct endpoint testing
- [x] Create unit tests for each component
- [ ] Add integration tests for full workflow

## 7. Security Features
- [ ] Implement proper credential storage
- [ ] Add command execution sandbox
- [ ] Create permission system for file access
- [ ] Add audit logging for computer use actions

## 8. Documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive README with examples
- [x] Document API parameters and response formats (captured via debug output)
- [x] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Create examples for common use cases

## 9. Deployment
- [ ] Package as installable Python module
- [ ] Create Docker container for isolated execution
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline for testing
- [ ] Add version tracking and upgrade path

## 10. Production Readiness
- [ ] Add proper error handling and recovery
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and backoff
- [ ] Create performance optimization
- [x] Add telemetry for reliability monitoring

## 11. Findings and Issues
- [x] Successfully authenticated to the Trae API /ping endpoint with mock token
- [x] Identified correct API endpoint structure at trae-api-us.mchost.guru
- [x] Fixed header format to use Cloud-IDE-JWT instead of Bearer token
- [x] Identified authentication issues with the actual Trae LLM endpoint (requires valid credentials)
- [x] Created unit tests with mocking to validate implementation without requiring actual API access
- [x] Confirmed that Trae is the actual API service - Cursor is merely a client application that uses the Trae API
