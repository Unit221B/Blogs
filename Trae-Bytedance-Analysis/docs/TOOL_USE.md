# Trae App Tool Use Analysis

This document analyzes how the Trae app interacts with Sonnet 3.7's tool use capabilities.

## Application Details

- **App**: Trae Desktop (Version 1.2.4, Build 1.0.10282)
- **Model**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet via AWS SDK
- **Platform**: macOS Sequoia (arm64)

## Key Findings

Based on traffic analysis and previous documentation, we've identified:

1. **AWS SDK Integration**: Trae app uses the AWS SDK to access Claude 3.7 Sonnet, as indicated by telemetry data containing `"chat_model":"aws_sdk_claude37_sonnet"`. This suggests interactions with the AWS Bedrock service rather than direct API access to Anthropic.

2. **Tool Use Architecture**: Tool use appears to be implemented in one of two ways:
   - **Client-Side Implementation**: Tools may be defined and executed within the Trae/VSCode extension locally
   - **Server-Side Implementation**: Tool definitions may be passed to Claude via the AWS Bedrock API

3. **Identified Tool Categories**:
   - **File Operations**: Read, write, create, and delete files
   - **Code Actions**: Format, edit, and optimize code
   - **Web Services**: Search and retrieve data from the web
   - **Shell Commands**: Execute terminal commands in a controlled environment

## JWT Authentication System

The Trae app uses a JWT-based authentication system that may have implications for tool use:

1. **JWT Token Structure**:
   - Tokens passed in `x-cloudide-token` or `authorization` headers
   - Authorization format: `Cloud-IDE-JWT eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
   - Uses RS256 algorithm for signature verification
   - Token likely contains permissions that determine available tools

2. **Token Contents**:
   ```json
   {
     "data": {
       "id": "7484083577249612805",
       "source": "refresh_token",
       "source_id": "6QdwN3GMUdkNmF6TR5MmD-ZpeFuPStY5K_ovv2DA1_g=.182fba6d4cb4d5ab",
       "tenant_id": "7o2d894p7dr0o4",
       "type": "user"
     },
     "exp": 1743075759,
     "iat": 1742816559
   }
   ```

## API Endpoints Relevant to Tool Use

From previous documentation, we've identified these potentially relevant endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description | Relation to Tool Use |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| `https://trae-api-us.mchost.guru/api/ide/v1/llm_raw_chat` | Direct LLM interactions | Likely endpoint for tool definitions and responses |
| `https://trae-api-us.mchost.guru/api/ide/v1/intents_config` | AI intentions/suggestions | May define available tools and capabilities |
| `https://api-us-east.trae.ai/cloudide/api/v3/trae/CheckLogin` | Validates login status | May determine tool permissions based on authenticated user |

## Tool Request Format (Hypothetical)

Based on understanding of AWS Bedrock's Claude API and our traffic analysis, the tool request format likely resembles:

```json
{
  "anthropic_version": "bedrock-2023-05-31",
  "max_tokens": 4096,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "User message requesting tool use"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "system": "You are Claude, an AI assistant...",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "read_file",
      "description": "Read the contents of a file",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "file_path": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Path to the file to read"
          }
        },
        "required": ["file_path"]
      }
    },
    // Additional tool definitions...
  ]
}
```

## Tool Response Format (Hypothetical)

When Claude uses a tool, the response likely follows this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "msg_01DXxxxxxxxx",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "I'll help you with that. Let me check the file content."
    },
    {
      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "tool_use_01DXxxxxxxxx",
      "name": "read_file",
      "input": {
        "file_path": "/path/to/file"
      }
    }
  ],
  "model": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
  "stop_reason": "tool_use",
  "stop_sequence": null,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 123,
    "output_tokens": 456
  }
}
```

## Tool Execution

Based on previous documentation, tool execution likely follows this process:

1. **Cloud IDE-based Tool Execution**: 
   - Tools may be executed in a sandboxed environment within the VSCode/Cloud IDE
   - File operations and shell commands are likely restricted by permission systems
   - Execution is tracked through telemetry (`code_comp_request` events)

2. **Permissions and Security**:
   - JWT token likely contains permissions that determine which tools are available
   - Potential implementation of a command execution sandbox
   - Permissions system for file access and other sensitive operations

3. **Multi-Step Tool Use Flow**:
   - Initial request with tool definition
   - Claude responds with tool_use block
   - Client executes tool locally
   - Results sent back to Claude
   - Claude generates final response

## Reverse Engineering Challenges

Capturing complete tool use flows presents several challenges:

1. **WebSocket Traffic**: Tool use interaction may occur over WebSockets, which our current proxy setup might not capture
   
2. **AWS Authentication**: We need to understand how AWS credentials are obtained and used

3. **Client-Side Execution**: Tool execution happens client-side, making it difficult to capture the complete flow

## Next Steps for Tool Use Analysis

1. **Modify Proxy Setup**:
   - Configure MITM proxy to capture WebSocket traffic
   - Look for AWS API calls to Bedrock or other AWS services

2. **Extract Tool Definitions**:
   - Analyze the Trae app's Claude extension to find tool definitions
   - Check for JSON schemas defining tool capabilities

3. **Token Analysis**:
   - Examine JWT tokens for tool permissions
   - Look for AWS credentials embedded in API calls

4. **Reverse Engineering**:
   - Consider extracting the Trae app's Claude extension files
   - Look for tool execution implementation in the codebase

5. **Testing Approach**:
   - Create specific prompts to trigger each tool type
   - Compare tool execution patterns across different types of tools
