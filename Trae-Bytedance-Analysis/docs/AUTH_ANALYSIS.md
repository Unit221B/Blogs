# Trae App Authentication Analysis

This document tracks the authentication flow and mechanisms used by the Trae app when communicating with Sonnet 3.7.

## Application Details

- **App**: Trae Desktop (Version 1.2.4, Build 1.0.10282)
- **Model**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet via AWS SDK 
- **Platform**: macOS Sequoia (arm64)

## Summary of Authentication Mechanisms

### Key Finding: AWS SDK Integration

Telemetry data confirms that Trae uses AWS SDK to access Claude 3.7 Sonnet:

```json
"chat_model":"aws_sdk_claude37_sonnet"
```

This indicates that authentication likely occurs through AWS credentials, not directly with Anthropic's API. Authentication now appears to be a multi-layer process:

1. **Trae App Authentication**: JWT-based authentication to Trae/ByteDance services
2. **AWS Authentication**: AWS credentials for accessing Bedrock/Claude services
3. **WebSocket Authentication**: Possible additional layer for real-time communication

### JWT-Based Authentication with Trae Services

Based on previous documentation, Trae uses a robust JWT-based authentication system:

1. **JWT Token Structure**
   - Tokens passed in `x-cloudide-token` or `authorization` headers
   - Authorization format: `Cloud-IDE-JWT eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
   - Uses RS256 algorithm (RSA + SHA-256) for signature verification

2. **JWT Payload Structure**
   ```json
   {
     "data": {
       "id": "7484083577249612805",
       "source": "refresh_token",
       "source_id": "6QdwN3GMUdkNmF6TR5MmD-ZpeFuPStY5K_ovv2DA1_g=.182fba6d4cb4d5ab",
       "tenant_id": "7o2d894p7dr0o4",
       "type": "user"
     },
     "exp": 1743075759,
     "iat": 1742816559
   }
   ```

3. **Login Status Check**
   - Endpoint: `https://api-us-east.trae.ai/cloudide/api/v3/trae/CheckLogin`
   - Uses the `x-cloudide-token` header
   - Validates if the current token is valid

4. **Token Refresh Mechanism**
   - JWT tokens have an expiration time (`exp`) and issue time (`iat`)
   - Likely refreshed using the `refresh_token` source indicated in the JWT payload

### AWS Authentication (Hypothesized)

AWS authentication for Bedrock likely uses one of these approaches:

1. **AWS Access Key ID/Secret Access Key**
   - Possibly embedded in requests to AWS services
   - May be obtained from the Trae backend upon authentication
   - Look for `X-Amz-` prefixed headers, common in AWS API requests

2. **AWS STS Temporary Credentials**
   - Short-lived credentials with limited permissions
   - May include session tokens in addition to access/secret keys
   - Typically refreshed periodically

3. **AWS Signature V4**
   - Request signing process for AWS API endpoints
   - Includes a signature derived from the request parameters and the secret key
   - Headers typically include `Authorization`, `X-Amz-Date`, `X-Amz-Content-Sha256`

### WebSocket Authentication

If the app is using WebSockets for real-time Claude interactions, authentication likely involves:

1. **Connection Establishment**
   - Initial connection with authentication token in query parameters or headers
   - Possibly uses the JWT token or AWS credentials for authentication

2. **Connection Maintenance**
   - Possible heartbeat messages to keep connection alive
   - May require periodic reauthentication

## Authentication Endpoints

Based on previous documentation, these endpoints are involved in authentication:

1. **Login Status Check**
   - `https://api-us-east.trae.ai/cloudide/api/v3/trae/CheckLogin`
   - Validates if the current token is valid

2. **Configuration Endpoint**
   - `https://api.trae.ai/icube/api/v1/native/config/query?machineId=...&deviceId=...&userId=...`
   - Contains user/device identifiers that may be part of authentication

3. **Device Log Endpoint**
   - `https://api-sg-central.trae.ai/icube/api/v1/device/log/check`
   - May involve device validation as part of security

## Authentication Flow

Previous documentation indicates this likely authentication flow:

1. **App Startup**
   - Application retrieves stored credentials (if any)
   - Validates stored tokens with `/CheckLogin` endpoint
   - If invalid, initiates login process

2. **User Authentication**
   - User enters credentials (exact flow not captured)
   - App receives JWT token from authentication service
   - JWT token stored for subsequent requests

3. **AWS Credential Acquisition**
   - App likely exchanges JWT token for AWS credentials (not directly observed)
   - AWS credentials used for Bedrock API access
   - These credentials may have limited scope and lifetime

4. **Claude Interaction**
   - AWS credentials used to authenticate requests to Claude 3.7 Sonnet
   - Each request properly signed with AWS Signature V4
   - Responses streamed back to the client

5. **Credential Refresh**
   - JWT tokens refreshed when approaching expiration
   - AWS credentials similarly refreshed as needed
   - Refresh processes handled transparently to user

## Authentication Security Features

1. **RS256 Algorithm**
   - Asymmetric encryption for token signing
   - Public key verifies signature, but cannot create new signatures
   - More secure than symmetric algorithms for distributed systems

2. **Token Expiration**
   - Limited token lifetime (appears to be ~3 days)
   - Reduces risk if tokens are compromised

3. **Multi-Layer Authentication**
   - JWT for Trae services
   - AWS credentials for AWS services
   - Machine/device/user IDs for additional identification

4. **Multi-Region Deployment**
   - Authentication services deployed across regions (US, Singapore)
   - Suggests sophisticated security infrastructure

## Identification Parameters

The app uses multiple identifiers as part of authentication:

- **Machine ID**: `01cf49a95ad927ea934d0ddb6eac0511d4c5ace138dee1a6eda9e0184a51bd8d`
- **Device ID**: `7484270930408703504`
- **User ID**: `7484083577249612805`
- **Session IDs**: Generated per session (e.g., `9bcc247f-5c49-47fa-89a5-b3776fdb4ad9`)
- **Tenant ID**: `7o2d894p7dr0o4` (from JWT payload)

## Questions for Further Investigation

1. **AWS Credential Source**
   - How does the app obtain AWS credentials?
   - Are AWS credentials derived from the JWT token, or provided separately?
   - Where are AWS credentials stored on the client?

2. **AWS Authentication Scope**
   - What AWS services does the app have permission to access?
   - Are permissions limited to specific Bedrock functionality?
   - How are rate limits and quotas enforced?

3. **WebSocket Authentication**
   - How are WebSockets authenticated if used?
   - Is there a separate token system for WebSocket connections?

4. **Token Storage**
   - Where and how are tokens stored locally?
   - What encryption is used for credential storage?

## Next Steps

1. **Capture AWS Authentication**
   - Modify proxy setup to capture AWS API calls
   - Look for AWS signature headers and authentication patterns

2. **Extract Stored Credentials**
   - Search app data directories for credential storage
   - Look for token/credential files or databases

3. **WebSocket Analysis**
   - Configure proxy to capture WebSocket traffic
   - Analyze WebSocket connection establishment and authentication

4. **Reverse Engineering**
